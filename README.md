# Bash Scripts #

This project contains a collection of bash scripts, which have been generically written. They should work on Unix, Linux, and likely work in Windows, provided one uses the unix shell.

## The **python-projects** folder ##

After fighting with `PyInstaller`, I have written two script that allow the user to:

1. create a command for a reliable python version.
2. compile via `PyInstaller` _within an encapsulated venv_ a python project.

The latter depends on the former, so one should check out both. Instructions for installation and usage are in each scripts.
